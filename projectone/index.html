          <p>I am a true tech nerd, learning about the newest technology that comes out or the newest software update for products always gets me very excited. </p>
          <p>I decided to study at techtree so that I could make websites that inspire people to be more creative.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Work</h2>
        <p>In this section i'd like to talk about things i was able to achieve in my professional career that i am proud of.</p>
        <p>First id like to say I am very lucky and greatful to work at club pro. My boss Steve Tyrer listens to his employees and fully supports their ideas. Having worked for other companies where new ideas and imporvements were shot down instantly this is a great releaf and somthing i really appreciate.</p>
        <p>At club pro my proudest achievements are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deploying computers at every work station replacing the daily paper hand outs</li>
          <li>creating a online schedule to let everyone know what jobs are completed in live time</li>
          <li>Overseeing new production lines being built</li>
        </ul>
